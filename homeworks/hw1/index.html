    Hi! I'm from SF. I am passionate about exploring the field of human centered design through interactive products. I believe that to build deep connections between humans and products, the design needs to emerge relatable experiences and memories that puts users in their comfort zone.
    I spend a lot of my spare time doing all sorts of activities! I am a big foodie and value spending quality time eating out with my friends and family. Once in a while I enjoy doing spontaneous activities such playing tennis, going on road trips, and exploring nature! On days that I want to chill at home, I create illustrations, paint on water bottles, and grind video games.
