					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned more about color accessibility. Some colors are rasher to read when they are next to other colors in similar shades. To ensure that there is enough contrast color to the background, the ratio should be at least 4.5:1 which I found very interesting. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like how they show the Do's and the Don'ts with colors. I think it makes it easier to see and compare colors. I also like how it provided ratios of colors so we know how much contrast ratio the colors are. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.” -- Justin Reyna</p>
						</li>
