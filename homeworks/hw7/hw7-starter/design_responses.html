						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I find it very interesting to learn about the Gestalt visual perception! While we only see the outlines, our brain is able to connect the dots and see images. It is also interesting that people can see ambiguous objects differently and have different perspectives. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed how the article explained the proximity principle and applied it to UI design. I was able to understand why we layout pages the way it is and understands how categories are getting grouped. I like how many visuals there to explain the material. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Elements arranged in a line or a soft curve are perceived to be more related than those arranged randomly or in a harsh line". I never thought about this.</p>
						</li>
